# customer-loyalty-prediction
Model created by Saeid Iranmanesh
developing a prediction model that uses SOM for unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional, discretised representation of the input space and use association table that joins “customer survey” and “customer profile” and feed them to the corresponding neural network (based on the cluster) to forecast customer loyalty.

accuracy in cluster 1: 98.98%

accuracy in cluster 2: 46.88%

accuracy in cluster 3: 96.20%

accuracy in cluster 4: 61.82%

The idea of clustering before training reduce the complexity of models and as we see the accuracy in half of the clusters is very high. This implies that customers distributed in these clusters can ne highly predicted to be loyal or churn.
